 DESCRIPTION OF TASK 3: As part of my internship at CodTech IT Solutions under the guidance of my mentor Neela Santosh, I was assigned a Data Visualization task using Tableau. The goal was to build a fully functional interactive dashboard that could visually explore key trends and patterns in a real-world housing dataset.

To begin, I imported a cleaned housing price dataset into Tableau. This dataset included variables like neighborhood, ground living area, sale price, year sold, overall quality, and sale condition. My objective was to present actionable insights through well-structured visualizations and to combine them into an interactive dashboard.

I created the following visualizations:

Bar Chart: Neighborhood-wise Average Sale Prices, showing how location impacts house pricing.

Scatter Plot: Ground Living Area (Sq Ft) vs Sale Price, revealing a clear positive correlation between area and price.

Horizontal Bar Chart: Average Sale Price by Overall Quality, highlighting how higher quality results in significantly higher prices.

Pie Chart: Sale Condition distribution, showing the proportion of different sale types contributing to overall sales.

Line Chart: Year Sold vs Average Sale Price to analyze pricing trends over time.

To make the dashboard interactive, I added filters:

Slider Filters for selecting ranges of Year Sold and Overall Quality.

Dropdown Filter to allow dynamic selection of neighborhoods.
These global filters enabled users to drill down into specific segments of the data.

Once the visualizations were finalized, I built the dashboard by strategically arranging all charts for clear readability. I ensured that filters applied globally across all relevant visuals. The dashboard allows users to intuitively explore how factors like neighborhood, house quality, living area, and sale condition influence house pricing over time.

This task enhanced my understanding of business intelligence tools, interactive analytics, and visual storytelling. It also improved my ability to think critically about data insights and user-friendly design.
